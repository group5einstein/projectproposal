The CHORE WEBSITE is an ICT project website proposed by Senior High School students of Tagum City National High School under the STEM strand that is meant for Job Sectors. With the purpose of helping to support the local businesses situated in  Tagum City, to help individuals to seek for side-jobs and would also help to develop a ICT literate community. It is designed to act as both search engine and database for chore-related tasks and for open jobs here in Tagum City.

WHAT IS A  CHORE WEBSITE?
         <br>
         <br>
  CHORE WEBSITE is a web-based platform that allows individuals to connect with other individuals seeking employment with a combination of both generic and industry-specific open positions. Organizations post open positions they are looking to fill through a specific job that would match their specific requirements and at the same time job-seeking individuals can visit the site to browse through side-job opportunities. For instance, an individual looking for a possible side-job  uses the CHORE WEBSITE as a way to land interviews. Organizations including local business owners, busy and lazy individuals would use CHORE WEBSITE as a database to post open positions and available slots for the given chore that helps them access the candidates resources that are qualified.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
         <br>
         <br>   
         <b>A client posts a job or chore. </b>
         <br>
The post must have a job description that should be descriptive enough that candidates understand if they are qualified for your open role. It should include the specific type of work, how that work will be completed, the skills required for the work.

         <br>
         <br>
The client must include posting  the salary rate for the chore or work and location.
Considering the fact that this is a job that exerts efforts, clients must be mindful enough with the basic pay and salary for the employer. It is also important to give exact details about your location to make sure a smooth transaction.

         <br>
         <br>
The Negotiation process.
Before accepting the offer, ask to look over the employment agreement and make sure you understand it, or get advice on its fairness before taking it.
         
         <br>
         <br>
If the employer agreed and received the Chore or job the post would be marked taken and or done.
And the same process goes with the other clients.

APPLYING FOR JOBS
Being offered a job is exciting. Although itâ€™s natural to want to accept it straight away, take the time to consider the offer because your reputation could be at stake if you back out later. Before you accept the offer, ask to look over the employment agreement and make sure you understand it, or get advice on its fairness before taking it.

         <br>
         <br>
Think about whether the employment agreement covers important things such as flexible working hours and the opportunity to learn new skills. If you're not completely happy, it could be worth trying to negotiate on pay, leave or training before you agree and take the job.
